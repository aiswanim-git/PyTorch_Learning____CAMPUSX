# PyTorch 101

Hey there ðŸ˜„, this is the repo where I have documented the .ipynb files that I created during my PyTorch Learning phase...

Feel free to check them out as they have very well explained basics (along with embedded images and textðŸ˜‰) to learn PyTorch from scratch !!   The Fashion MNIST dataset(available on Kaggle) has been used for the initial notebooks.

I myself am in the learning phase ðŸ˜…....but I plan to expand the repo more as I get to learn newer things about PyTorch and some related projects.
